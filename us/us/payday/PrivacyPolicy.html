  <strong>Important Disclosures. Please Read Carefully.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  This service is not available in all states. If you request a loan in a particular state where such loans are prohibited,
  or in a location where http://lendingleaf.in/us/payday does not have an available lender, you will not be connected to a lender. In
  some cases, you may be given the option of obtaining a loan from a tribal lender. Tribal lenders are subject to tribal
  and certain federal laws while being immune from state law including usury caps. If you are connected to a tribal lender,
  please understand that the tribal lender’s rates and fees may be higher than state-licensed lenders. Additionally, tribal
  lenders may require you to agree to resolve any disputes in a tribal jurisdiction. You are urged to read and understand
  the terms of any loan offered by any lender, whether tribal or state-licensed, and to reject any particular loan offer
  that you cannot afford to repay or that includes terms that are not acceptable to you.
</p>

<p>
  The purpose of shorter duration loans is to provide the borrower temporary financial relief. Such loans are not a long-term
  financial solution. Persons facing serious financial difficulties should consider other alternatives or should seek out
  professional financial advice.
</p>
<p>
  This website is not an offer to lend. http://lendingleaf.in/us/payday is not a lender and does not make loan or credit decisions. http://lendingleaf.in/us/payday
  connects interested persons with a lender from its network of approved lenders. http://lendingleaf.in/us/payday does not control and
  is not responsible for the actions or inactions of any lender, is not an agent, representative or broker of any lender,
  and does not endorse any lender. http://lendingleaf.in/us/payday receives compensation from its lenders, often based on a ping-tree
  model similar to Google AdWords where the highest available bidder is connected to the consumer. Regardless, http://lendingleaf.in/us/payday’s
  service is always free to you.
</p>

<p>
  By submitting your information via this website, you are authorizing http://lendingleaf.in/us/payday and its partners to do a credit check,
  which may include verifying your social security number, driver license number or other identification, and a review of
  your creditworthiness. Credit checks are usually performed by one of the major credit bureaus such as Experian, Equifax
  and TransUnion, but also may include alternative credit bureaus such as Teletrack, DP Bureau or others. You also authorize
  http://lendingleaf.in/us/payday to share your information and credit history with a network of approved lenders and lending partners.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Lender’s Disclosure of Terms.</strong>
</p>
<p>The lender you are connected to will provide documents that contain all fees and rate information pertaining to the loan
  being offered, including any potential fees for late-payments and the rules under which you may be allowed (if permitted
  by applicable law) to refinance, renew or rollover your loan. Loan fees and interest rates are determined solely by the
  lender based on the lender’s internal policies, underwriting criteria and applicable law. http://lendingleaf.in/us/payday has no knowledge
  of or control over the loan terms offered by a lender. You are urged to read and understand the terms of any loan offered
  by any lender, whether tribal or state-licensed, and to reject any particular loan offer that you cannot afford to repay
  or that includes terms that are not acceptable to you.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Late Payments Hurt Your Credit Score</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Please be aware that missing a payment or making a late payment can negatively impact your credit score. To protect yourself
  and your credit history, make sure you only accept loan terms that you can afford to repay. If you cannot make a payment
  on time, you should contact your lender immediately and discuss how to handle late payments.
